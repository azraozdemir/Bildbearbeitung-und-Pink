                The color pink has a long and varied history. In the 18th
                century, it became associated with femininity and delicacy due
                to the influence of the Rococo art movement. In the early 20th
                century, the suffragette movement in the United States embraced
                pink as a symbol of their cause. Today, pink is also a symbol of
                pride in the LGBTQ+ community.In these cases, the color pink is
                used as a way to visually represent and unify a group of people
                who are fighting for a common cause.
